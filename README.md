Slides from a summer course I taught on NLP.  The PDFs are the slides for the class and in notebooks_instructor you can find the notebooks corresponding to each class.

The week's topics are:
1) From text to tokens
2) From tokens to vectors of information
3) Contextualizing vectors (RNNs/LSTMs and word embeddings)
4) Attention and Transformers
5) Scoping NLP projects
6) NLP use-cases
7) Ethics and bias in NLP
